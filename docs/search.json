    "text": "Aim and Learning Objectives\nThis sub-module aims to provide training and skills on a set of basic quantitative research methods for data collection, analysis, and interpretation. You will learn how to define coherent, relevant research questions, utilise various research quantitative methods, and identify appropriate methodologies to tackle your research questions. This block serves as the foundation for the dissertation and fieldwork modules.\nBackground\nData and research are key pillars of the global economy and society today. We need rigorous approaches to collecting and analysing both the statistics that can tell us ‘how much’ and if there are observable relationships between phenomena; and the information gives us a nuanced understanding of cultural contexts and human dynamics. Quantitative skills enable us to explore and measure socio-economic activities and processes at large scales, while qualitative skills enable understanding of social, cultural, and political contexts and diverse lived experiences. Rather than being in opposition, qualitative and quantitative research can complement one another in the investigation of today’s pressing research questions.\nTo these ends, this block will help you develop your quantitative (statistical) skills, as critical tools. This course will help you understand what quantitative statistical researchers use and develop a set of research techniques that can be used in your field classes and dissertations.\nLearning objectives:",

    "text": "How to get there?\nThe first stage is to identify ONE a relevant research question to be addressed. Based on the chosen question, you will need to identify a dependent (or outcome) variable which you want to explain, and at least two relevant independent variables that you can use to explain the chosen dependent variable. The selection of variables should be informed by the literature and empirical evidence.\nTo detail in the Methods Section: Once the variables have been chosen, you will need to describe the data and appropriate type of regression to be used for the analysis. You need to explain any transformation done to the original data source, such as reclassifying variables, or changing variables from continuous to nominal scales. You also need to briefly describe the data use: source of data, year of data collection, indicate the number of records used, state if you are using individual records or geographical units, explain if you are selecting a sample, and any relevant details. You also need to identify type of regression to be used and why.\nTo detail in the Results and Discussion Section: Firstly, you need to provide two types of analyses. First, you need to provide a descriptive analysis of the data. Here you could use tables and/or plots reporting relevant descriptive statistics, such as the mean, median and standard deviation; variable distributions using histograms; and relationships between variables using correlation matrices or scatter plots. Secondly, you need to present an estimated regression model or models and the interpretation of the estimated coefficients. You need a careful and critical analysis of the regression estimates. You should think that you intend to use your regression models to advice your boss who is expecting to make some decisions based on the information you will provide. As part of this process, you need to discuss the model assessment results for the overall model and regression coefficients. Remember to substantiate your arguments using relevant literature and evidence, and present results clearly in tables and graphs.",

Most of the cutting-edge statistical research is first available on R.\nR is a script based language, so there is no point and click interface. While the initial learning curve will be steeper, understanding how to write scripts will be valuable because it leaves a clear description of what steps you performed in your data analysis. Typically you will want to write a script in a separate file and then run individual lines. This saves you from having to retype a bunch of commands and speeds up the debugging process.",

    "text": "1.2 R(Studio) Basics\nWe will be running R through the program RStudio which is located at rstudio.com. When you first open up RStudio the console window gives you some information about the version of R you are running and then it gives the prompt &gt;. This prompt is waiting for you to input a command. The prompt + tells you that the current command is spanning multiple lines. In a script file you might have typed something like this:\nfor( i in 1:5 ){\n    print(i)\n}\nFinding help about a certain function is very easy. At the prompt, just type help(function.name) or ?function.name. If you don’t know the name of the function, your best bet is to go the the web page www.rseek.org which will search various R resources for your keyword(s). Another great resource is the coding question and answer site stackoverflow.\n\n1.2.1 Starting a session in RStudio\nUpon startup, RStudio will look something like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: the Pane Layout and Appearance settings can be altered:\n\non Windows by clicking RStudio&gt;Tools&gt;Global Options&gt;Appearance or Pane Layout\non Mac OS by clicking RStudio&gt;Preferences&gt;Appearance or Pane Layout.\n\nYou will also have a standard white background; but you can choose specific themes.\nSource Panel (Top-Left)\nThis is where you write, edit, and view scripts, R Markdown/Quarto documents, or R scripts. It allows:\n\nEditing Scripts: Write and edit R scripts or documents (.R, .Rmd, .qmd).\nExecuting the Code: Run lines, blocks, or the entire script directly from the editor.\n\nConsole Panel (Bottom-Left)\nThe Console is the main place to run R commands interactively. It allows:\n\nExecuting the Code: Type and run R commands directly.\nViewing outputs, warnings, and errors for immediate feedback.\nBrowsing and reusing past commands (History Tab).\nToggling between the R Console, and the Terminal (yuo don’t really need the latter).\n\nEnvironment Panel (Top-Right)\nThis panel helps track variables, functions, and the history of commands used. It contains:\n\nEnvironment Tab: Shows all current variables, datasets, and objects in your session, including their structure and values.\nHistory Tab: Provides a record of past commands. You can re-run or move commands to the console or script.\n\nFiles / Plots / Packages / Help Panel (Bottom-Right)\nThis multifunctional panel is for file navigation, plotting, managing packages, viewing help, and managing jobs. It contains:\n\nFiles Tab: Navigate, open, and manage files and directories within your project.\nPlots Tab: Displays plots generated in your session. You can export or navigate through multiple plots here.\nPackages Tab: Lists installed packages and allows you to install, load, and update packages.\nHelp Tab: Displays help documentation for R functions, packages, and other resources. You can search for documentation by typing a function or package name.\n\nImportant: Unless you are working with a script, you will be likely writing code on the console.\nAt the start of a session, it’s good practice clearing your R environment (console):\n\nrm(list = ls())\n\nIn R, we are going to be working with relative paths. With the command getwd(), you can see where your working directory is currently set.\n\ngetwd() \n\nFor ENVS225, download the material of the module an unzip it whever you like.\nThe folder structure should look like:\nstats/\n├── data/\n├── labs_img/\n└── labs/\nYou can delete other sub-folders (e.g. docs).\nThis should be on your personal computer or if on a local machine, I suggest using the directory M: to store the folder, it can be accessed from every computer.\nThen, in R Studio - on Windows by clicking RStudio&gt;Tools&gt;Global Options&gt;General.. - on Mac OS by clicking RStudio&gt;Preferences&gt;Appearance or Pane Layout…\nbrowse and set the folder you just creted as your working directory.\nCheck if that has been applied.\n\ngetwd() \n\nFile paths in R work like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Path\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nMyFile.csv\nLook in the working directory for MyFile.csv.\n\n\nMyFolder/MyFile.csv\nIn the working directory, there is a subdirectory called MyFolder and inside that folder is MyFile.csv.\n\n\n\nYou do not need to set your working directory if you are using an R-markdown or Quarto document and you have it saved in the right location. The pathway will start from where your document is saved.\n\n\n1.2.2 Using the console\nTry to use the console to perform a few operations. For example type in:\n\n1+1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nSlightly more complicated:\n\nprint(\"hello world\")\n\n[1] \"hello world\"\n\n\nIf you are unsure about what a command does, use the “Help” panel in your Files pane or type ?function in the console. For example, to see how the dplyr::rename() function works, type in ?dplyr::rename. When you see the double colon syntax like in the previous command, it’s a call to a package without loading its library.\n\n\n1.2.3 R as a simple calculator\nYou can use R as a simple calculator. At the prompt, type 2+3 and hit enter. What you should see is the following\n\n# Some simple addition\n2+3\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nIn this fashion you can use R as a very capable calculator.\n\n6*8\n\n[1] 48\n\n4^3\n\n[1] 64\n\nexp(1)   # exp() is the exponential function\n\n[1] 2.718282\n\n\nR has most constants and common mathematical functions you could ever want. For example, the absolute value of a number is given by abs(), and round() will round a value to the nearest integer.\n\npi     # the constant 3.14159265...\n\n[1] 3.141593\n\nabs(1.77) \n\n[1] 1.77\n\n\nWhenever you call a function, there will be some arguments that are mandatory, and some that are optional and the arguments are separated by a comma. In the above statements the function abs() requires at least one argument, and that is the number you want the absolute value of.\nWhen functions require more than one argument, arguments can be specified via the order in which they are passed or by naming the arguments. So for the log() function, for example, which calculates the logarithm of a number, one can specify the arguments using the named values; the order woudn’t matter:\n\n# Demonstrating order does not matter if you specify\n# which argument is which\nlog(x=5, base=10)   \n\n[1] 0.69897\n\nlog(base=10, x=5)\n\n[1] 0.69897\n\n\nWhen we don’t specify which argument is which, R will decide that x is the first argument, and base is the second.\n\n# If not specified, R will assume the second value is the base...\nlog(5, 10)\n\n[1] 0.69897\n\nlog(10, 5)\n\n[1] 1.430677\n\n\nWhen we want to specify the arguments, we can do so using the name=value notation.\n\n\n1.2.4 Variables Assignment\nWe need to be able to assign a value to a variable to be able to use it later. R does this by using an arrow &lt;- or an equal sign =. While R supports either, for readability, I suggest people pick one assignment operator and stick with it.\nVariable names cannot start with a number, may not include spaces, and are case sensitive.\n\nvar &lt;- 2*7.5       # create two variables\nanother_var = 5   # notice they show up in 'Environment' tab in RStudio!\nvar \n\n[1] 15\n\nvar * another_var \n\n[1] 75\n\n\nAs your analysis gets more complicated, you’ll want to save the results to a variable so that you can access the results later. If you don’t assign the result to a variable, you have no way of accessing the result.\n\n\n1.2.5 Working with Scripts\nR Scripts (.R files)\nTraditional script files look like this:\n\n# Problem 1 \n# Calculate the log of a couple of values and make a plot\n# of the log function from 0 to 3\nlog(0)\nlog(1)\nlog(2)\nx &lt;- seq(.1,3, length=1000)\nplot(x, log(x))\n\n# Problem 2\n# Calculate the exponential function of a couple of values\n# and make a plot of the function from -2 to 2\nexp(-2)\nexp(0)\nexp(2)\nx &lt;- seq(-2, 2, length=1000)\nplot(x, exp(x))\n\nIn RStudio you can create a new script by going to File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script. This opens a new window in RStudio where you can type commands and functions as a common text editor.\nThis looks perfectly acceptable as a way of documenting what one does, but this script file doesn’t contain the actual results of commands you ran, nor does it show you the plots. Also anytime you want to comment on some output, it needs to be offset with the commenting character #. It would be nice to have both the commands and the results merged into one document. This is what the R Markdown file does for us.\nR Markdown (.Rmd and .qmd files)\nThe R Markdown is an implementation of the Markdown syntax that makes it extremely easy to write webpages or scientific documents that include conde. This syntax was extended to allow users to embed R code directly into more complex documents. Perhaps the easiest way to understand the syntax is to look at an at the RMarkdown website.\nThe R code in a R Markdown document (.rmd file extension) can be nicely separated from regular text using the three backticks (3 times `, see below) and an instruction that it is R code that needs to be evaluated. A code chunk will look like:\n\n    for (i in 1:5) {print(i)}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n[1] 5\n\n\nIn ENVS225: In this module we will be using .qmd a more flexible development of .rmd files.\nMarkdown files present several advantages compared to writing your code in the console or just using scripts. You’ll save yourself a huge amount of work by embracing Markdown files from the beginning; you will keep track of your code and your steps, be able to document and present how you did your analysis (helpful when writing the methods section of a paper), and it will make it easier to re-run an analysis after a change in the data (such as additional data values, transformed data, or removal of outliers) or once you spot an error. Finally, it makes the script more readable.\n\n\n1.2.6 R Packages\nOne of the greatest strengths about R is that so many people have developed add-on packages to do some additional function. To download and install the package from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), you just need to ask RStudio it to install it via the menu Tools -&gt; Install Packages.... Once there, you just need to give the name of the package and RStudio will download and install the package on your computer.\nOnce a package is downloaded and installed on your computer, it is available, but it is not loaded into your current R session by default. To improve overall performance only a few packages are loaded by default and the you must explicitly load packages whenever you want to use them. You only need to load them once per session/script.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)   # load the dplyr library, will be useful later",

See here for how to format normal text in Markdown documents\nRemember, when you want to write code in a markdown document you have to enclose it like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor you can insert it manually:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin this module we will be working with data stored in so-called datasets. A dataset is a structured collection of data points that represent various measurements or observations, often organized in a tabular format with rows and columns. A dataset might contain information about different locations, such as neighborhoods or cities, with each row representing a place and each column detailing characteristics like population density, average income, or number of green parks. For example, a dataset could be compiled to study patterns in urban mobility, where the data includes the number of daily commuters, the distance they travel, and the mode of transport they use. Datasets provide the essential building blocks for statistical analysis; they enable exploring relationships, identifying patterns, and drawing conclusions about certatin phenomena.\nExamples of everyday datasets:\n\nPremier League Standings: Each row represents a team, with columns for points, games played, wins, draws, and losses.\nMovie Dataset: Each row represents a movie, with columns showing its title, genre, release year, director, and rating.\nWeather Dataset: Each row shows a day’s weather in a city, with columns for temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.\n\nUsually, data is organized in\n\nColumns of data representing some trait or variable that we might be interested in. In general, we might wish to investigate the relationship between variables.\nRows represent a single object on which the column traits are measured.\n\nFor example, in a grade book for recording students scores throughout the semester, their is one row for every student and columns for each assignment. A greenhouse experiment dataset will have a row for every plant and columns for treatment type and biomass.\n\n1.3.1 Datasets in R\nIn R, we want a way of storing data where it feels just as if we had an Excel Spreadsheet where each row represents an observation and each column represents some information about that observation. We will call this object a data.frame, an R represention of a data set. The easiest way to understand data frames is to create one.\n\nTask: Copy the code below in your markdown. Create a data.frame that represents an instructor’s grade book, where each row is a student, and each column represents some sort of assessment.\n\n\nGrades &lt;- data.frame(\n  Name  = c('Bob','Jeff','Mary','Valerie'),     \n  Exam.1 = c(90, 75, 92, 85),\n  Exam.2 = c(87, 71, 95, 81)\n)\n# Show the data.frame \n# View(Grades)  # show the data in an Excel-like tab.  Doesn't work when knitting \nGrades          # show the output in the console. This works when knitting\n\n     Name Exam.1 Exam.2\n1     Bob     90     87\n2    Jeff     75     71\n3    Mary     92     95\n4 Valerie     85     81\n\n\nTo execute just one chunk of code press the green arrow top-right of the chunk:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR allows two differnt was to access elements of the data.frame. First is a matrix-like notation for accessing particular values.\n\n\n\nFormat\nResult\n\n\n\n\n[a,b]\nElement in row a and column b\n\n\n[a,]\nAll of row a\n\n\n[,b]\nAll of column b\n\n\n\nBecause the columns have meaning and we have given them column names, it is desirable to want to access an element by the name of the column as opposed to the column number.\n\nTask: Copy and Run:\n\n\nGrades[, 2]       # print out all of column 2 \n\n[1] 90 75 92 85\n\nGrades$Name       # The $-sign means to reference a column by its label\n\n[1] \"Bob\"     \"Jeff\"    \"Mary\"    \"Valerie\"\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Importing Data in R\nFrom: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dereksonderegger/570L/master/07_DataImport.Rmd\nUsually we won’t type the data in by hand, but rather load the data from some package. Reading data from external sources is a necessary skill.\nComma Separated Values Data\nTo consider how data might be stored, we first consider the simplest file format: the comma separated values file (.csv). In this file time, each of the “cells” of data are separated by a comma. For example, the data file storing scores for three students might be as follows:\nAble, Dave, 98, 92, 94\nBowles, Jason, 85, 89, 91\nCarr, Jasmine, 81, 96, 97\nTypically when you open up such a file on a computer with MS Excel installed, Excel will open up the file assuming it is a spreadsheet and put each element in its own cell. However, you can also open the file using a more primitive program (say Notepad in Windows, TextEdit on a Mac) you’ll see the raw form of the data.\nHaving just the raw data without any sort of column header is problematic (which of the three exams was the final??). Ideally we would have column headers that store the name of the column.\nLastName, FirstName, Exam1, Exam2, FinalExam\nAble, Dave, 98, 92, 94\nBowles, Jason, 85, 89, 91\nCarr, Jasmine, 81, 96, 97\nReading (.csv) files\nTo make R read in the data arranged in this format, we need to tell R three things:\n\nWhere does the data live? Often this will be the name of a file on your computer, but the file could just as easily live on the internet (provided your computer has internet access).\nIs the first row data or is it the column names?\nWhat character separates the data? Some programs store data using tabs to distinguish between elements, some others use white space. R’s mechanism for reading in data is flexible enough to allow you to specify what the separator is.\n\nThe primary function that we’ll use to read data from a file and into R is the function read.csv(). This function has many optional arguments but the most commonly used ones are outlined in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfile\nRequired\nA character string denoting the file location.\n\n\nheader\nTRUE\nSpecifies whether the first line contains column headers.\n\n\nsep\n\",\"\nSpecifies the character that separates columns. For read.csv(), this is usually a comma.\n\n\nskip\n0\nThe number of lines to skip before reading data; useful for files with descriptive text before the actual data.\n\n\nna.strings\n\"NA\"\nValues that represent missing data; multiple values can be specified, e.g., c(\"NA\", \"-9999\").\n\n\nquote\n\"\nSpecifies the character used to quote character strings, typically \" or '.\n\n\nstringsAsFactors\nFALSE\nControls whether character strings are converted to factors; FALSE means they remain as character data.\n\n\nrow.names\nNULL\nAllows specifying a column as row names, or assigning NULL to use default indexing for rows.\n\n\ncolClasses\nNULL\nSpecifies the data type for each column to speed up reading for large files, e.g., c(\"character\", \"numeric\").\n\n\nencoding\n\"unknown\"\nSets the text encoding of the file, which can be useful for files with special or international characters.\n\n\n\nMost of the time you just need to specify the file. |\n\nTask: Let’s read in a dataset of terrorist attacks that have taken place in the UK:\n\n\nattacks &lt;- read.csv(file   = '../data/attacksUK.csv')  # where the data lives                                 \nView(attacks)",

    "text": "1.4 Practice: Descriptive Statistics\n\n1.4.1 Summarizing Data\nIt is very important to be able to take a data set and produce summary statistics such as the mean and standard deviation of a column. For this sort of manipulation, we use the package dplyr. This package allows chaining together many common actions to form a particular task.\nThe foundational operations to perform on a data set are:\n\nSubsetting - Returns a with only particular columns or rows\n– select - Selecting a subset of columns by name or column number.\n– filter - Selecting a subset of rows from a data frame based on logical expressions.\n– slice - Selecting a subset of rows by row number.\narrange - Re-ordering the rows of a data frame.\nmutate - Add a new column that is some function of other columns.\nsummarise - calculate some summary statistic of a column of data. This collapses a set of rows into a single row.\n\nEach of these operations is a function in the package dplyr. These functions all have a similar calling syntax,: - The first argument is a data set;. - Subsequent arguments describe what to do with the input data frame and you can refer to the columns without using the df$column notation.\nAll of these functions will return a data set.\nThe dplyr package also includes a function that “pipes” commands together. The idea is that the %&gt;% operator works by translating the command a %&gt;% f(b) to the expression f(a,b). This operator works on any function f. The beauty of this comes when you have a suite of functions that takes input arguments of the same type as their output. For example if we wanted to start with x, and first apply function f(), then g(), and then h(), the usual R command would be h(g(f(x))) which is hard to read because you have to start reading at the innermost set of parentheses. Using the pipe command %&gt;%, this sequence of operations becomes x %&gt;% f() %&gt;% g() %&gt;% h(). For example:\n\nGrades # Recall the Grades data \n\n     Name Exam.1 Exam.2\n1     Bob     90     87\n2    Jeff     75     71\n3    Mary     92     95\n4 Valerie     85     81\n\n# The following code takes the Grades data.frame and calculates \n# a column for the average exam score, and then sorts the data \n# according to the that average score\nGrades %&gt;%\n  mutate( Avg.Score = (Exam.1 + Exam.2) / 2 ) %&gt;%\n  arrange( Avg.Score )\n\n     Name Exam.1 Exam.2 Avg.Score\n1    Jeff     75     71      73.0\n2 Valerie     85     81      83.0\n3     Bob     90     87      88.5\n4    Mary     92     95      93.5\n\n\nKeep it in mind, it is not necessary to memorise this.\nLet’s consider the summarize function to calculate the mean score for Exam.1. Notice that this takes a data frame of four rows, and summarizes it down to just one row that represents the summarized data for all four students.\n\nlibrary(dplyr) # load the library\nGrades %&gt;%\n  summarize( Exam.1.mean = mean( Exam.1 ) )\n\n  Exam.1.mean\n1        85.5\n\n\nSimilarly you could calculate the standard deviation for the exam as well.\n\nGrades %&gt;%\n  summarize( Exam.1.mean = mean( Exam.1 ),\n             Exam.1.sd   = sd(   Exam.1   ) )\n\n  Exam.1.mean Exam.1.sd\n1        85.5  7.593857\n\n\n\nTask: Write the code above in your markdown file and run it. Do not to copy it this time.\n\nLet’s go back to the terrorist attacks. There are attacks perpetrated by several different groups. Each record is a single attack and contains information about who perpetrated the attack, what year, how many were killed and how many were wounded. You can get a glimpse of the dataframe with the function head\n\nhead(attacks, n = 10)\n\n   nrKilled nrWound year        country                        group\n1         0       0 2005 United Kingdom   Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades\n2         0       0 2005 United Kingdom   Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades\n3         0       0 2005 United Kingdom   Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades\n4         0       0 2005 United Kingdom   Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades\n5         0       1 1982 United Kingdom Abu Nidal Organization (ANO)\n6         0       0 2014 United Kingdom                   Anarchists\n7         0       0 2014 United Kingdom                   Anarchists\n8         0       0 2014 United Kingdom                   Anarchists\n9         0       0 2014 United Kingdom                   Anarchists\n10        0       0 2014 United Kingdom                   Anarchists\n                           attack                      target\n1               Bombing/Explosion              Transportation\n2               Bombing/Explosion              Transportation\n3               Bombing/Explosion              Transportation\n4               Bombing/Explosion              Transportation\n5                   Assassination     Government (Diplomatic)\n6  Facility/Infrastructure Attack                    Business\n7  Facility/Infrastructure Attack                    Business\n8  Facility/Infrastructure Attack                    Business\n9  Facility/Infrastructure Attack Private Citizens & Property\n10 Facility/Infrastructure Attack                      Police\n                      weapon\n1  Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite\n2  Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite\n3  Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite\n4  Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite\n5                   Firearms\n6                 Incendiary\n7                 Incendiary\n8                 Incendiary\n9                 Incendiary\n10                Incendiary\n\n\nWe might want to compare different actors and see the mean and standard deviation of the number of people wound, by each group’s attack, across time. To do this, we are still going to use the summarize, but we will precede that with group_by(group) to tell the subsequent dplyr functions to perform the actions separately for each breed.\n\nattacks %&gt;%\n  group_by( group) %&gt;%\n  summarise( Mean = mean(attacks$nrWound), \n             Std.Dev = sd(attacks$nrWound))\n\n# A tibble: 38 × 3\n   group                                               Mean Std.Dev\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                              &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades                         0.963    7.22\n 2 Abu Nidal Organization (ANO)                       0.963    7.22\n 3 Anarchists                                         0.963    7.22\n 4 Animal Liberation Front (ALF)                      0.963    7.22\n 5 Animal Rights Activists                            0.963    7.22\n 6 Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia 0.963    7.22\n 7 Black September                                    0.963    7.22\n 8 Continuity Irish Republican Army (CIRA)            0.963    7.22\n 9 Dissident Republicans                              0.963    7.22\n10 Informal Anarchist Federation                      0.963    7.22\n# ℹ 28 more rows\n\n\n\nTask: Write the code above in your markdown file and run it. Try out another categorical variable instead of group (e.g. year) and nrKilled instead of nrWound.\n\nLet’s now move to another dataset to address a research question. For illustration purposes, we will use the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS is an annual survey conducted by the UK government that collects detailed information about the income, living conditions, and resources of private households across the United Kingdom. Managed by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), the FRS provides data that is essential for understanding the economic and social conditions of households and informing public policy.\nConsider questions such as:\n\nHow many respondents (persons) are there in the 2016-17 FRS?\nHow many variables (population attributes) are there?\nWhat types of variables are present in the FRS?\nWhat is the most detailed geography available in the FRS?\n\n\nTask: To answer these questions, load and inspect the dataset.\n\n\n# the FRS dataset should be already loaded, otherwise\nfrs_data &lt;-

Understanding the Structure of the FRS Datafile\nIn the FRS data structure, each row represents a person, but:\n\nEach person is nested within a family.\nEach family is nested within a household.\n\nBelow is an example dataset

all belong to the same household (household 1); they also all belong to the same family. This family comprises a married middle-aged couple plus their three children, one of whom is a stepson.\nThe second household (household 2) comprises only one person – a single middle-aged male.The third household comprises another married couple, this time with two children.\nSuperficially the fourth household looks similar to households 1 and 2: a married couple plus their daughter. The difference is that this particular married couple is nearing retirement age, and their daughter is middle-aged. Consequently, despite being a child of the married couple, the middle-aged daughter is treated as a separate ‘family’ (family 2 in the household). This is because the FRS (and Census) define a ‘family’ as a couple plus any ‘dependent’ children. A dependent child is defined as a child who is either` aged 0-15 or aged 16-19, unmarried and in full-time education. All children aged 16-19 who are married or no longer in full-time education are regarded as ‘independent’ adults who form their own family unit, as are all children aged 20+.\nThe inclusion of all persons in a household allows us more flexibility in the types of research question we can answer. For example, we could explore how the likelihood of a woman being in paid employment WorkStatus is influenced by the age of the youngest child still living in her family (if any) fam_youngest.\nIn the FRS (and Census), a “family” is defined as a couple and any “dependent” children. Dependent children are defined as those aged 0–15, or aged 16–19 if unmarried and in full-time education.\n\n\n1.4.3 Explore the Distribution of Your Outcome Variable\nBefore starting your analysis, it is critical to know the type of scale used to measure your outcome variable: is it categorical or continuous? Here we will start off by exploring a continuous variable which can then turn into a categorical variable (e.g. top earners: yes or no). We explore the income distribution in the UK by first looking at the low and high end of the distribution ie. What sorts of people have high (or low) incomes?\nIn the FRS each person’s annual income is recorded, both gross (pre-tax) and net (post-tax). This income includes all income sources, including earnings, profits, investment returns, state benefits, occupational pensions etc. As it is possible to make a loss on some of these activities, it is also possible (although unusual) for someone’s gross or net annual income in a given year to be negative (representing an overall loss).\n\nTask: Load the FRS dataset into your R environment, if it’s not already loaded, and inspect the data.\n\n\n# Load the dataset (replace 'frs_data.csv' with the actual file path)\nfrs_data &lt;- read.csv(\"../data/FamilyResourceSurvey/FRS16-17_labels.csv\") \n\nOpen the dataset in RStudio’s Data Viewer to explore its structure, including the income_gross and income_net variables.\n\n # Open the data in the RStudio Viewer\n View(frs_data)\n\nin the Data Viewer tab, scroll horizontally to locate the income_gross and income_net columns. If columns are listed alphabetically, they will appear near other attributes that start with “income.”\nYou should notice two things:\n\nIncomes are recorded to the nearest £, NOT in income bands.\nDependent children almost all have a recorded income of £0.\n\nThis second observation highlights the somewhat loose wording of our question above (What sorts of people have high (or low) incomes?). To avoid reaching the somewhat banal conclusion that those with the lowest of all incomes are almost all children, we should re-frame the question more precisely as What sorts of people (excluding dependent children) have low incomes?\n\nTask: Determine the Scale of the Outcome Variable.\n\n\n# Summarize income variables\nsummary(frs_data$income_gross)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n-358592       0   12012   14204   20384 1110928 \n\n\n\nTask: Exclude Dependent Children.\n\nYou need to select all cases (persons) that are independent, that is where the variable dependent has values different from != “Dependent” or equal == “Independent”.\n\n# Filter to include only independent persons\nfrs_independent &lt;- frs_data %&gt;% filter(dependent != \"Dependent\")\n\n\nTask: Create a basic histogram (a visualisation lecture is scheduled later on).\n\nThe income variables in the FRS are all scale variables so a good starting point is to examine its distribution looking at a histogram of income_gross.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n \n ggplot(frs_independent, aes(x = income_gross)) +\n   geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000, fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\") +\n   labs(\n     title = \"Distribution of Gross Household Income\",\n     x = \"Gross Income (£)\",\n     y = \"Frequency\"\n   ) +\n   xlim(0, 90000) +\n   theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see the histogram below. It reveals that the income distribution is very skewed with few people earning high salaries and the majority earning just over or less 35,000 annually.\n\nTask: Adopt a regrouping strategy.\n\nYou can also cross-tabulate gross (or net) income with any of the other variables in the FRS to your heart’s content – or can you?\nAgain, here is important to recall that the income variables in the FRS are all ‘scale’ variables; in other words, they are precise measures rather than broad categories. Consequently, every single person in the FRS potentially has their own unique income value. That could make for a table c. 44,000 rows long (one row per person) if each person has their own unique value. The solution is to create a categorical version of the original income variable by assigning each person to one of a set of income categories (income bands). Having done this, cross-tabulation then becomes possible.\nBut which strategy to use? Equal intervals, percentiles or ‘ad hoc’. Here I would suggest that ‘ad hoc’ is best: all you want to do is to allocate each independent adult to one of three arbitrarily defined groups: ‘low’, ‘middle’ and ‘high’ income.

Using the chosen census datasets, visualise the association between the % of population with bad health (pct_Very_bad_health) and each of the following:\n\nthe % of population with no qualifications (pct_No_qualifications);\nthe % of population aged 65 to 84 (pct_Age_65_to_84);\nthe % of population in a married couple (pct_Married_couple);\nthe % of population in a Higher Managerial or Professional occupation (pct_Higher_manager_prof).\n\n\n# Scatterplot for each variable variables \nvariables &lt;- c(\"pct_No_qualifications\", \"pct_Age_65_to_84\", \"pct_Married_couple\", \"pct_Higher_manager_prof\")\n\n# Loop to create scatterplots and calculate correlations \n# x and y variables for each scatter plot,\nfor (var in variables) { \n  # Scatterplot \n  ggplot(census, aes_string(x = var, y = \"pct_Very_bad_health\")) +\n    geom_point() + \n    labs(title = paste(\"Scatterplot of pct_Very_bad_health vs\", var), \n         x = var, y = \"pct_Very_bad_health\") +\n    theme_minimal()\n}\n\nWarning: `aes_string()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0.\nℹ Please use tidy evaluation idioms with `aes()`.\nℹ See also `vignette(\"ggplot2-in-packages\")` for more information.\n\n\nQ2. Which of the associations do you think is strongest, which one is the weakest?\nAs noted, before, an observed association between two variables is no guarantee of causation. It could be that the observed association is:\n\nsimply a chance one due to sampling uncertainty;\ncaused by some third underlying variable which explains the spatial variation of both of the variables in the scatterplot;\ndue to the inherent arbitrariness of the boundaries used to define the areas being analysed (the ‘Modifiable Area Unit Problem’).\n\nQ3. Setting these caveats to one side, are the associations observed in the scatter-plots suggestive of any causative mechanisms of bad health?\nRather than relying upon an impressionistic view of the strength of the association between two variables, we can measure that association by calculating the relevant correlation coefficient. The Table below identifies the statistically appropriate measure of correlation to use between two continuous variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Data Type\nMeasure of Correlation\nRange\n\n\n\n\nBoth symmetrically distributed\nPearson’s\n-1 to +1\n\n\nOne or both with a skewed distribution\nSpearman’s Rank\n-1 to +1\n\n\n\nDifferent Calculation Methods: Pearson’s correlation assumes linear relationships and is suitable for symmetrically distributed (normally distributed) variables, measuring the strength of the linear relationship. Spearman’s rank correlation, however, works on ranked data, so it’s more suitable for skewed data or variables with non-linear relationships, measuring the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship.\nWhen calculating correlation for a single pair of variables, select the method that best fits their data distribution:\n-   Use **Pearson’s** if both variables are symmetrically distributed.\n-   Use **Spearman’s** if one or both variables are skewed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can check the distribution of a variable (e.g. pct_No_qualifications like this):\n\n# Plot histogram with density overlay for a chosen variable (e.g., 'pct_No_qualifications')\nggplot(census, aes(x = pct_No_qualifications)) + \n    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30, color = \"black\", fill = \"skyblue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n    geom_density(color = \"darkblue\", size = 1) +\n    labs(title = \"Distribution of pct_No_qualifications\", x = \"Value\", y =  \"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..density..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(density)` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen analyzing multiple pairs of variables, using different measures (Pearson for some pairs, Spearman for others) creates inconsistencies since Pearson and Spearman values aren’t directly comparable in size due to their different calculation methods. To maintain consistency across comparisons, calculate both Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlations for each pair. Check if the trends align (both showing strong, weak, or moderate correlation in the same direction). This consistency check can give confidence that the relationships observed are not dependent on the correlation method chosen. While in a report, you’d typically include only one set of correlations (usually Pearson’s if the relationships appear linear), calculating both can validate that your observations aren’t an artifact of the correlation method.\n\nResearch Question 1: Which of our selected variables are most strongly correlated with % of population with bad health?\n\nTo answer this question, complete the Table below by editing/running this code:.\nPearson correlations\n\npearson_correlation &lt;- cor(census$pct_Very_bad_health,\n    census$pct_No_qualifications,use = \"complete.obs\", method = \"pearson\")\n    \n# Display the results\ncat(\"Pearson Correlation:\", pearson_correlation, \"\\n\")\n\nPearson Correlation: 0.7620569 \n\n\nSpearman correlations:\n\nspearman_correlation &lt;- cor(census$pct_Very_bad_health,\n    census$pct_No_qualifications, use = \"complete.obs\", method = \"spearman\")\n\ncat(\"Spearman Correlation:\", spearman_correlation, \"\\n\")\n\nSpearman Correlation: 0.7785197 \n\n\n\n\n\nCovariates\nPearson\nSpearman\n\n\n\n\npct_Very_bad_health - pct_No_qualifications\n\n\n\n\npct_Very_bad_health - pct_Age_65_to_84\n\n\n\n\npct_Very_bad_health - pct_Married_couple\n\n\n\n\npct_Very_bad_health - pct_Higher_manager_prof\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can you make of this numbers?\nIf you think you have found a correlation between two variables in our dataset, this doesn’t mean that an association exists between these two variables in the population at large. The uncertainty arises because, by chance, the random sample included in our dataset might not be fully representative of the wider population.\nFor this reason, we need to verify whether the correlation is statistically significant,\n\n# significance test for pearson, for example\npearson_test &lt;- cor.test(census$pct_Very_bad_health,\n    census$pct_No_qualifications, method = \"pearson\", use = \"complete.obs\")\npearson_test\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  census$pct_Very_bad_health and census$pct_No_qualifications\nt = 21.347, df = 329, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.7128142 0.8038232\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.7620569 \n\n\nLook at https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/cor.test for details about the function. But in general, when calculating the correlation between two variables, a p-value accompanies the correlation coefficient to indicate the statistical significance of the observed association. This p-value tests the null hypothesis that there is no association between the two variables (i.e., that the correlation is zero).\nWhen interpreting p-values, certain thresholds denote different levels of confidence. A p-value less than 0.05 is generally considered statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, suggesting that we can be 95% confident there is an association between the variables in the broader population. When the p-value is below 0.01, the result is significant at the 99% confidence level, meaning we have even greater confidence (99%) that an association exists. Sometimes, on research papers or tables significance levels are denoted with asterisks: one asterisk (*) typically indicates significance at the 95% level (p &lt; 0.05), two asterisks (**) significance at the 99% level (p &lt; 0.01), three asterisks (***) significance at the 99.99% level (p &lt; 0.01).\nTypically, p-values are reported under labels such as “Sig (2-tailed),” where “2-tailed” refers to the fact that the test considers both directions (positive and negative correlations). Reporting the exact p-value (e.g., p = 0.002) is more informative than using thresholds alone, as it gives a clearer picture of how strongly the data contradicts the null hypothesis of no association.\nIn a nutshell, lower p-values suggest a stronger statistical basis for believing that an observed correlation is not due to random chance. A statistically significant p-value reinforces confidence that an association likely exists in the wider population, though it does not imply causation.\n\n\n2.1.3 Part. 2: Implementing a Linear Regression Model\nA key goal of data analysis is to explore the potential factors of health at the local district level. So far, we have used cross-tabulations and various bivariate correlation analysis methods to explore the relationships between variables. One key limitation of standard correlation analysis is that it remains hard to look at the associations of an outcome/dependent variable to multiple independent/predictor variables at the same time. Regression analysis provides a very useful and flexible methodological framework for such a purpose. Therefore, we will investigate how various local factors impact residents’ health by building a multiple linear regression model in R.\nWe use pct_Very_bad_health as a proxy for residents’ health.\n\nResearch Question 2: How do local factors affect residents’ health?\n\nDependent (or Outcome) Variable:\n\n% of population with bad health (pct_Very_bad_health).\n\nIndependent (or Predictor) Variables:\n\n% of population with no qualifications (pct_No_qualifications).\n% of male population (pct_Males).\n% of population in a higher managerial/professional occupation (pct_Higher_manager_prof).\n\nLoad some other Libraries\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ readr     2.1.5     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(broom)\n\nand the data (if not loaded):\n\n# Load dataset\ncensus &lt;- read.csv(\"../data/Census2021/EW_DistrictPercentages.csv\")\n\nRegression models are the standard method for constructing predictive and explanatory models. They tell us how changes in one variable (the target variable or independent variable, \\(Y\\)) are associated with changes in explanatory variables, or dependent variables, \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\) (\\(X_n\\)), etc. Classic linear regression is referred to Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression because they estimate the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable \\(y\\) using a hyperplane (i.e. a multi-dimensional line) that minimises the sum of the squared difference between the observed values of y and the values predicted by the model (denoted as \\(\\hat{y}\\), \\(y\\)-hat).\nHaving seen Single Linear Regression in class - where the relationship between one independent variable and a dependent variable is modeled - we can extend this concept to situations where more than one predictor might influence the outcome. While single linear regression helps us understand the effect of ONE variable in isolation, real-world phenomena are often influenced by multiple factors simultaneously. Multiple linear regression addresses this complexity by allowing us to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables, providing a more comprehensive view of how various predictors contribute to changes in the outcome.\nHere, regression allows us to examine the relationship between people’s health rates and multiple predictors.\nBefore starting, we define two hypotheses:\n\nNull hyphotesis (\\(H_0\\)): For each variable \\(X_n\\), there is no effect of \\(X_n\\) on \\(Y\\).\nAlternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)): There is an effect of\\(X_n\\) on Y.\n\nWe will observe if we can reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n2.1.4 Model fit\n\n# Linear regression model\nmodel &lt;- lm(pct_Very_bad_health ~ pct_No_qualifications + pct_Males + pct_Higher_manager_prof, data = census)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = pct_Very_bad_health ~ pct_No_qualifications + pct_Males + \n    pct_Higher_manager_prof, data = census)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.49028 -0.13686 -0.03516  0.09834  0.76575 \n\nCoefficients:\n                         Estimate Std.

Slopes: These are the other regression coefficients of an independent variable, e.g. \\(β_1\\), i.e. estimated average changes in \\(Y\\) for a one unit change in an indepdent variable, e.g. \\(X_1\\), when all other dependent or explanatory variables are held constant.\nThere are two key points worth mentioning:\n\nThe unit of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\): you need to know what the units are of the independent and dependent variables. For instance, one unit could be one year if you have an age variable, or a one percentage point if the variable is measured in percentages (all the variables in this week’s practical).\nAll the other explanatory variables are held constant. It means that the coefficient of an explanatory variable \\(x_1\\) (e.g. \\(b_1\\)) should be interpreted as: a one unit change in\\(x_1\\) is associated with b1 units change in \\(Y\\), keeping other values of explanatory variables (e.g. \\(x_2\\), \\(x_3\\)) constant – for instance, \\(x_2\\)= 0.1 or \\(x_3\\)= 0.4.\n\nFor the independent variable \\(X\\), we can derive how changes of 1 unit for the independent are associated with the changes in pct_Very_bad_health:\nFor example:\n\nThe association of pct_No_qualifications is positive and strong: each increase in 1% of pct_No_qualifications is associated with an increase of 0.05% of long term illness rate.\nThe association of pct_Males is negative and strong: each decrease in 1% of pct_Males is associated with an increase of 0.07% of pct_Very_bad_health in the population in England and Wales.\nThe association of pct_Higher_manager_prof is negative but weak: each decrease in 1% of pct_Higher_manager_prof is associated with an increase of 0.013% of pct_Very_bad_health.\n\n\n\n2.1.5.2 P-values and Significance\nThe t tests of regression coefficients are used to judge the statistical inferences on regression coefficients, i.e. associations between independent variables and the outcome variable. For a t-statistic of a dependent variable, there is a corresponding p-value that indicates different levels of significance in the column Pr(&gt;|t|) and the asterisks ∗∗.\n\n*** indicates “changes in \\(X_n\\) are significantly associated with changes in \\(Y\\) at the &lt;0.001 level”.\n** suggests that “changes in \\(X_n\\) are significantly associated with changes in \\(Y\\) between the 0.001 and (&lt;) 0.01 levels”.\nNow you should know what * means: The significance is between the 0.01 and 0.05 levels, which means that we observe a less significant (but still significant) relationship between the variables.\n\nThe p-value provides a measure of how significant the relationship is; it is an indication of whether the relationship between \\(X_n\\) and \\(Y\\) found in this data could have been found by chance. Very small p-values suggest that the level of association found here might not have come from a random sample of data.\nIn this case, we can say:\n\nGiven that the p-value is indicated by ***, changes in pct_No_qualifications and pct_Males are significantly associated with changes in pct_Very_bad_health at the &lt;0.001 level; the association is highly statistically significant; we can be confident that the observed relationship between these variables and pct_Very_bad_health is not due to chance.\nGiven that the p-value is indicated by **, changes in pct_Higher_manager_prof are significantly associated with changes in pct_Very_bad_health at the 0.001 level. This means that the association between the indepedent and dependent variable is not one that would be found by chance in a series of random sample 99.999% of the time.\n\nIn both cases we can then confidently reject the Null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\): no association between dependent and indepdent variables exist).\nRemember, If the p-value of a coefficient is smaller than 0.05, that coefficient is statistically significant. In this case, you can say that the relationship between this independent variable and the outcome variable is statistically significant. Contrarily, if the p-value of a coefficient is larger than 0.05 you can conclude that there is no evidence of an association or relationship between the independent variable and the outcome variable.\n\n\n2.1.5.3 R-squared and Adjusted R-squared\nThese provide a measure of model fit. This is calculated as the difference between the actual value of \\(Y\\) and the value predicted by the model. In our model, the R-squared and Adjusted R-squared are greater than 0.6, thus indicating a well fitting model.\nThe R-squared and Adjusted R-squared values are statistical measures that indicate how well the independent variables in your model explain the variability of the dependent variable. Both R-squared and Adjusted R-squared are commonly used to evaluate the fit of a linear regression model—meaning, they help us understand how closely the model’s predictions align with the actual data. An R-squared of 0.6, for example, indicates that 60% of the variability in YYY is explained by the predictors in the model. The remaining 40% is due to other factors not captured by the model.\nAdjusted R-squared also measures the goodness of fit, but it adjusts for the number of predictors in the model, accounting for the fact that adding more variables can artificially inflate R-squared without genuinely improving the model. Adjusted R-squared is especially useful when comparing models with different numbers of predictors. If Adjusted R-squared is close to or above 0.6, as in your example, it implies that the model has a strong explanatory power while not being overfit with unnecessary predictors.\nA high R-squared and Adjusted R-squared indicate that the model captures much of the variation in the data, making it more reliable for predictions or for understanding the relationship between YYY and the predictor variables. However Low R-squared values suggest that the model might be missing important predictors or that the relationship between \\(Y\\) and the explanatory variables is not well-captured by a linear approach.\nAn R-squared and Adjusted R-squared over 0.6 are generally seen as signs of a well-fitting model in many fields, though the ideal values can depend on the context and the complexity of the data.\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Interpreting the Results\n\n# Format regression results for reporting\nresults_table &lt;- coefficients %&gt;%\n  select(term, estimate, statistic, p.value)\nresults_table\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 4\n  term                    estimate statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)               4.02        4.57 7.06e- 6\n2 pct_No_qualifications     0.0530      8.96 2.54e-17\n3 pct_Males                -0.0739     -4.14 4.40e- 5\n4 pct_Higher_manager_prof  -0.0131     -2.65 8.43e- 3\n\n\nQ4. Complete the table above by filling in the coefficients, t-values, p-values, and indicating if each variable is statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nCoefficients\nt-values\np-values\nSignificant?\n\n\n\n\npct_No_qualifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\npct_Males\n\n\n\n\n\n\npct_Higher_manager_prof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the lecture notes, you know that the Intercept or Constant represents the estimated average value of the outcome variable when the values of all independent variables are equal to zero.\nQ5. When values of pct_Males, pct_No_qualifications and pct_Higher_manager_prof are all \\(zero\\), what is the % of population with very bad health? Is the intercept term meaningful? Think about whether there are districts with a zero percentage of population with no qualification. Are there any districts (or zones, depending on the dataset you chose) with zero percentages of persons with no qualification in your data set?\nQ6. Interpret the regression coefficients of pct_Males, pct_No_qualifications and pct_Higher_manager_prof. Do they make sense?\n\n\n2.1.7 Identify factors of % bad health\nNow combine the above two sections and identify factors affecting the percentage of population with very bad health. Fill in each row for the direction (positive or negative) and significance level of each variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nPositive or Negative\nStatistical Significance\n\n\n\n\npct_No_qualifications\n\n\n\n\npct_Higher_manager_prof\n\n\n\n\npct_Males\n\n\n\n\n\nQ7. Think about the potential conclusions that can be drawn from the above analyses. Try to answer the research question of this practical: How do local factors affect residents’ health? Think about causation vs association and consider potential confounders when interpreting the results. How could these findings influence local health policies?",

Which is the weakest?\n\nAs before, rather than relying upon an impressionistic view of the strength of the association between two variables, we can measure that association by calculating the relevant correlation coefficient.\nTo calculate the correlation between categorical data, we first use Chi-squared test to assess the independence between pairs of categorical variables, then we use Cramer’s V to measures the strength of association - the correlation coefficents in R.\nPearson’s chi-squared test (χ2) is a statistical test applied to sets of categorical data to evaluate how likely it is that any observed difference between the sets arose by chance. If the p-value is low (typically &lt; 0.05), it suggests a significant association between the two variables.\n\nchisq.test(frs_data$health,frs_data$happy) \n\nWarning in chisq.test(frs_data$health, frs_data$happy): Chi-squared\napproximation may be incorrect\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  frs_data$health and frs_data$happy\nX-squared = 45594, df = 60, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\nIf you see a warning message of Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect. This is because some expected frequencies in one or more cells of the cross-tabular (health * happy) are too low. The df means degrees of freedom and it related to the size of the table and the number of categories in each variable. The most important message from the output is the estimated p-value, which shows as p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 (2.2 with 16 decimals move to the left, it is a very small number so written in scientific notation). P-value of the chi-squared test is far smaller than 0.05, so we can say the correlation is statistically significant.\nCramér’s V is a measure of association for categorical (nominal or ordinal) data. It ranges from 0 (no association) to 1 (strong association). The main downside of using Cramer’s V is that no information is provided on whether the correlation is positive or negative. This is not a problem if the variable pair includes a nominal variable but represents an information loss if the both variables being correlated are ordinal.\n\n# Install the 'vcd' package if not installed \nif(!require(\"vcd\"))   \ninstall.packages(\"vcd\", repos = \"https://cran.r-project.org\")\n\nLoading required package: vcd\n\n\nWarning: package 'vcd' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nLoading required package: grid\n\nlibrary(vcd)  \n\n# Calculate Cramér's V \nassocstats(table(frs_data$health, frs_data$happy))\n\n                   X^2 df P(&gt; X^2)\nLikelihood Ratio 54036 60        0\nPearson          45594 60        0\n\nPhi-Coefficient   : NA \nContingency Coeff.: 0.713 \nCramer's V        : 0.454 \n\n\n\nResearch Question 1.

    "text": "3.2 Implementing a linear regression model with a qualitative independent variable\n\nResearch Question 2: How does health vary across regions in the UK?\n\nThe practical is split into two main parts. The first focuses on implementing a linear regression model with a qualitative independent variable. Note that you need first to set the reference category (baseline) as the outcomes of the model reflects the differences between categories with the baseline. The second part focuses prediction based the estimated linear regression model.\nFirst we load the UK district-level census dataset.\n\n# load data\nLAcensus &lt;- read.csv(\"../data/Census2011/UK_DistrictPercentages.csv\") # Local authority level\n\nUsing the district-level census dataset “UK_DistrictPercentages.csv”. the variable “Region” (labelled as Government Office Region) is used to explore regional inequality in health.\nFamiliar yourself with the dataset by using the same codes as last week:\n\n#view the data \nView(LAcensus)  \nglimpse(LAcensus)\n\nThe names() function returns all the column names.\n\nnames(df)\n\nThe dim() function can merely returns the number of rows and number of columns.\n\ndim(LAcensus) \n\n[1] 406 128\n\n\nThere are 406 rows and 130 columns in the dataset. It would be very hard to scan throught the data if we use so many variables altogether. Therefore, we can select several columns to tailor for this practical. You can of course include other variables you are interested in also by their names:\n\ndf &lt;- LAcensus %&gt;% select(c(\"pct_Long_term_ill\",\n                            \"pct_No_qualifications\",\n                            \"pct_Males\",\n                            \"pct_Higher_manager_prof\",\n                            \"Region\"))\n\nSimply descriptive of this new data\n\nsummary(df)\n\n pct_Long_term_ill pct_No_qualifications   pct_Males    \n Min.   :11.20     Min.   : 6.721        Min.   :47.49  \n 1st Qu.:15.57     1st Qu.:19.406        1st Qu.:48.67  \n Median :18.41     Median :23.056        Median :49.09  \n Mean   :18.27     Mean   :23.257        Mean   :49.10  \n 3rd Qu.:20.72     3rd Qu.:26.993        3rd Qu.:49.48  \n Max.   :27.97     Max.   :40.522        Max.   :55.47  \n pct_Higher_manager_prof     Region      \n Min.   : 4.006          Min.   : 1.000  \n 1st Qu.: 7.664          1st Qu.: 3.000  \n Median : 9.969          Median : 6.000  \n Mean   :10.747          Mean   : 6.034  \n 3rd Qu.:12.986          3rd Qu.: 8.000  \n Max.   :37.022          Max.   :12.000  \n\n\nNow we can retrieve the “Region” column from the data frame by simply use df$Region. But what if we want to understand the data better, like the following questions?\n\nQ2. How many categories do the variable “Region” entail? How many local authority districts does each region include?\n\nSimply use the function table() would return you the answer.\n\ntable(df$Region) \n\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 \n40 47 33 12 39 67 37 30 21 22 32 26 \n\n\nThe numbers in Region column indicate different regions in the UK - 1: East Midlands; 2: East of England; 3: London; 4: North East; 5: North West; 6: South East; 7: South West; 8: West Midlands; 9: Yorkshire and the Humber; 10: Wales; 11: Scotland; and 12: Northern Ireland.\nThe table() function tells us that this data frame contains 12 regions, and the number of LAs belongs to each region.\nNow, for better interpration of our regions with their real name rather than the code, we can create a new column named “Region_label” by using the following code. **R can only include the categorical variables in the factor type, so we set the new column Region_label in factor()\n\ndf$Region_label &lt;- factor(df$Region,c(1:12),labels=c(\"East Midlands\",\n                                                     \"East of England\",\n                                                     \"London\",\n                                                     \"North East\",\n                                                     \"North West\",\n                                                     \"South East\",\n                                                     \"South West\",\n                                                     \"West Midlands\",\n                                                     \"Yorkshire and the Humber\",\n                                                     \"Wales\",\n                                                     \"Scotland\",\n                                                     \"Northern Ireland\")) \n\nIf you re-run the table() function, the output is now more readable:\n\ntable(df$Region_label)\n\n\n           East Midlands          East of England                   London \n                      40                       47                       33 \n              North East               North West               South East \n                      12                       39                       67 \n              South West            West Midlands Yorkshire and the Humber \n                      37                       30                       21 \n                   Wales                 Scotland         Northern Ireland \n                      22                       32                       26 \n\n\n\n3.2.1 Include the categorical variables into a regression model\nWe will continue with a very similar regression model fitted in last week that relates Percentages long-term illness (pct_Long_term_ill) to Percentages no-qualification (pct_No_qualifications), Percentage Males (pct_Males) and Percentages Higher Managerial or Professional occupation (pct_Higher_manager_prof).\nDecide which region to be set as the baseline category. The principle is that if you want to compare the (average) long term illness outcome of Region A to those of other regions, Region A should be chosen as the baseline category. For example, if you want to compare the (average) long term illness outcome of London to rest of regions in the UK, London should be selected as the baseline category.\nImplement the regression model with the newly created categorical variables - Region_label in our case. R will automatically handle the qualitative variable as dummy variables so you don’t need to concern any of that. But you need to let R knows which category of your qualitative variable is your reference category or the baseline. Here we will use London as our first go. Note: We choose London as the baseline category so the London region will be excluded in the independent variable list.\nTherefore, first, we set London as the reference:\n\ndf$Region_label &lt;- relevel(df$Region_label, ref = \"London\")\n\nSimilar to last week, we build our linear regression model, but also include the Region_label variable into the model.\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(pct_Long_term_ill ~ pct_Males + pct_No_qualifications + pct_Higher_manager_prof + Region_label, data = df)\n\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = pct_Long_term_ill ~ pct_Males + pct_No_qualifications + \n    pct_Higher_manager_prof + Region_label, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.2963 -0.9090 -0.1266  0.8168  5.2821 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                     Estimate Std.

Relating back to this week’s lecture notes, indicate what regions have statistically significant differences in the percentage of long-term illness, compared to London?\n\nFirst, the Significance and the Coefficient Estimates. By examining the P-value, which is the last column in the output table, we can see that most of the independent variables are significant predictor of pct_Long_term_ill.\n\nSimilarly to last week, we learn that the changes in pct_No_qualifications and pct_Malesare significantly associated with changes in pct_Long_term_ill at the &lt;0.001 level (with the three asterisks *** ), which is actually an indicator of highly statistically significant, while we are less confident that the observed relationship between pct_Higher_manager_prof and pct_Long_term_ill are statistically significant (with the two asterisks **). Through their coefficient estimates, we learn that:\n\nThe association of pct_Males is negative and strong: each decrease in 1% of pct_Males is associated with an increase of 0.75% of long term illness rate in the population of UK.\nThe association of pct_No_qualifications is positive and strong: each increase in 1% of pct_No_qualifications is associated with an increase of 0.5% of long term illness rate.\nThe association of pct_Higher_manager_prof is positive but weak: each increase in 1% of pct_Higher_manager_prof is associated with an increase of 0.08% of pct_Long_term_ill.\n\nNow comes to the dummy variables (all the items starts with Region_label) created by R for our qualitative variable Region_label: Region_labelNorth East, Region_labelNorth West, Region_labelSouth West and Region_labelWales are also statistically significant at the &lt;0.001 level. The changes in Region_labelEast Midlands are significantly associated with changes in pct_Long_term_ill at the 0.001 level, while the changes in Region_labelWest Midlands and Region_labelYorkshire and the Humber are significantly associated with changes in pct_Long_term_ill at the 0.01 level. The 0.01 level suggests that it is a mild likelihood that the relationship between these independent variables and the dependent variable is not due to random change. They are just mildly statistically significant.\nThe coefficient estimates of them need to be interpreted by comparing to the reference category London. The Estimate column tells us: North East region is associated with a 2.7% higher rate of long term illness than London when the other predictors remain the same. Similarly, Wales is 4.6% higher rate of long term illness than London when the other predictors remain the same. You can draw the conclusion for the other regions in this way by using their coefficient estimate values.\nReminder: You cannot draw conclusion between North East and Wales, nor comparison between any regions beyond London. It is because the regression model is built for the comparison between regions to your reference category London. If we want to compare between North East and Wales, we need to set either of them as the reference category by using df$Region_label &lt;- relevel(df$Region_label, ref = \"North East\") or df$Region_label &lt;- relevel(df$Region_label, ref = \"Wales\").\nRegion_labelEast of England, Region_labelSouth Eest, Region_labelScotland and RegionlabelNorthern Ireland were not found to be significantly associated with pct_Long_term_ill.\n\nLast but not least, the Measure of Model Fit. The model output suggests the R-squared and Adjusted R-squared are of greater than 0.8 indicate a reasonably well fitting model. he model explains 83.0 % of the variance in the dependent variable. After adjusting for the number of independent variable, the model explains 82.4% of the variance. They two suggest a strong fit of the model.\nNow, complete the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion names\nHigher or lower than London\nWhether the difference is statistically significant (Yes or No)\n\n\n\n\nEast Midlands\n\n\n\n\nEast of England\n\n\n\n\nNorth East\n\n\n\n\nNorth West\n\n\n\n\nSouth East\n\n\n\n\nSouth West\n\n\n\n\nWest Midlands\n\n\n\n\nYorkshire and The Humber\n\n\n\n\nWales\n\n\n\n\nScotland\n\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Change the baseline category\nIf you would like to learn about differences in long-term illness between East of England and other regions in the UK, you need to change the baseline category (from London) to the East of England region (with variable name “Region_2”).\n\ndf$Region_label &lt;- relevel(df$Region_label, ref = \"East of England\")\n\nThe regression model is specified again as follows:\n\nmodel1 &lt;- lm(pct_Long_term_ill ~ pct_Males + pct_No_qualifications + pct_Higher_manager_prof + Region_label, data = df)\n\nsummary(model1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = pct_Long_term_ill ~ pct_Males + pct_No_qualifications + \n    pct_Higher_manager_prof + Region_label, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.2963 -0.9090 -0.1266  0.8168  5.2821 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                     Estimate Std.

For example, in this case study, we are interested in health inequality between London, Other regions in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. We can achieve this by re-grouping regions in the UK based on the variable “Region”. That said, we need to have a new grouping of regions as follows:\n\n\n\nOriginal region labels\nNew region labels\n\n\nEast Midlands\nOther regions in England\n\n\nEast of England\nOther regions in England\n\n\nLondon\nLondon\n\n\nNorth East\nOther regions in England\n\n\nNorth West\nOther regions in England\n\n\nSouth East\nOther regions in England\n\n\nSouth West\nOther regions in England\n\n\nWest Midlands\nOther regions in England\n\n\nYorkshire and The Humber\nOther regions in England\n\n\nWales\nWales\n\n\nScotland\nScotland\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nHere we use mutate() function in R to make it happen:\n\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(New_region_label = if_else(!Region_label %in% c(\"London\",\"Wales\",\"Scotland\",\"Northern Ireland\"), \"Other regions in England\",Region_label))\n\nThis code may looks a bit complex. You can simply type ?mutate in your console. Now in your right hand Help window, the R studio offers your the explanation of the mutate function. This is a common way you can use R studio to help you learn what the function caate() creates new columns that are functions of existing variables. Therefore, the df %&gt;% mutate() means add a new column into the current dataframe df; the New_region_label in the mutate() function indicates the name of this new column is New_region_label. The right side of the New_region_label = indicates the value we want to assign to the New_region_label in each row.\nThe right side of New_region_label is\nif_else(!Region_label %in% c(\"London\",\"Wales\",\"Scotland\",\"Northern Ireland\"), \"Other regions in England\",Region_label))\nBy using the code, the if_else() function checks whether each value in the Region_label column is not (!)one of the specified regions: “London”, “Wales”, “Scotland”, or “Northern Ireland”. If the region is not in this list, the value is replaced with the label “Other regions in England”. If the region is one of these four, the original value in Region_label is retained. This process categorizes regions that are outside of the four specified ones into a new group labeled “Other regions in England”, while preserving the original labels for the specified regions.\nNow we use the same way to examine our new column New_region_label:\n\ntable(df$New_region_label)\n\n\n                  London         Northern Ireland Other regions in England \n                      33                       26                      293 \n                Scotland                    Wales \n                      32                       22 \n\n\nComparing with the Region_label, we now can see the mutate worked:\n\ndf[,c(\"Region_label\",\"New_region_label\")]\n\nNow you will have a new qualitative variable named New_region_label in which the UK is divided into five regions: London, Other regions in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nBased on the newly generated qualitative variable New_region_label, we can now build our new linear regression model. Don’t forget:\n(1) R need to deal with the categorical variables in regression model in the factor type;\n\ndf$New_region_label = as.factor(df$New_region_label)\n\n2) Let R know which region you want to use as the baseline category. Here I will use London again, but of course you can choose other regions.\n\ndf$New_region_label &lt;- relevel(df$New_region_label, ref = \"London\")\n\nThe linear regression window is set up below. This time we include New_region_label rather than Region_label as the region variable:\n\nmodel2 &lt;- lm(pct_Long_term_ill ~ pct_Males + pct_No_qualifications + pct_Higher_manager_prof + New_region_label, data = df)\n\nsummary(model2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = pct_Long_term_ill ~ pct_Males + pct_No_qualifications + \n    pct_Higher_manager_prof + New_region_label, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-4.6719 -1.1252 -0.0556  0.9564  7.3768 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                          Estimate Std.

    "text": "3.4 Income inequality with respect to gender and health status\nIn this section, we will work with individual-level data (“FRS 2016-17_label.csv”) again to explore income inequality with respect to gender and health status.\nTo explore income inequality, we need to work with a data set excluding dependent children. In addition, we look at individuals who are the representative persons of households. Therefore, we will select cases (or samples) that meet both conditions.\nWe want R to select persons only if they are the representative persons of households and they are not dependent children. The involved variables are hrp and Dependent for the categories “Household Reference Person” and “independent”, you can select the appropriate cases. We also want to exclude the health variable reported as “Not known”.\n\nfrs_df &lt;- frs_data %&gt;% filter(hrp==\"HRP\" & dependent==\"Independent\" & health!=\"Not known\") \n\nThen, we create a new numeric variable Net_inc_perc indicate net income per capita as our dependent variable:\n\nfrs_df$Net_inc_perc = frs_df$hh_income_net / frs_df$hh_size\n\nOur two qualitative independent variables “sex” and “health”.

Yes. First, make sure they are in factor type and Second, decide the reference category. Here, I will use Male and Fair health status as my base categories. You can decide what you wish to use.
